For now I have 2 classes (Users and Members), which members inherits the 3 attributes from Users.

- THE CODE -
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Users{
    public:
    string name;
    string password;
    int id;
};

class Members: public Users{
};

int main(){
Members member1;

member1.name = "Mike";
member1.password = "Pword123";
member1.id = 1234;
}
